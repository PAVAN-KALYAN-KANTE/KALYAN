        <p class="well">With the cut off of well reputed universities shooting high year after year, students are compelled to motivate themselves and to their best in their board examinations and entrance exams. This requires students to put in hours of studies, flipping
            through the textbook pages, grasping and chewing the texts, memorising everything, and filling the answer sheets with long answers. We understand that this can get exhausting, making you throw your hands up and say “I am done with this”. Wait!
            Is giving up really an option? Think about it. These exams and tests are important because they are going to open the gates to the future you have chosen. Sure you can exercise, watch youtube videos, text your friends, or go down for a walk.
            However, all these are things work as breaks from your studying hours. They don’t really help you to keep going on. The solution to this is to keep motivating yourself. So here we are to do just that. We are here to motivate you in the best
            way. </p>
